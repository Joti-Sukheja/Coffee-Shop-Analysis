# Steps and Formulas for Coffee Shop Analysis

## 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate rows.
- Corrected inconsistencies in date formats.
- Standardized column names (e.g., "Order Date" -> "Date").
- Checked for missing values and filled them where necessary:
  - Example: Used average for missing sales values.
  
## 2. Data Analysis
- Added columns for:
  - Hour of Order: Extracted from the "Order Time" column using `=HOUR(OrderTime)`.
  - Month Name: Derived from the "Date" column using `=TEXT(Date, "mmmm")`.
- Created PivotTables:
  - Total sales and orders grouped by:
    - Hour, Day of the Week, and Month.
  - Breakdown of sales by item category and item size.

## 3. Dashboard Creation
- Used slicers for dynamic filtering:
  - Slicers: Hour of the day, Day of the week, Month.
- Visualizations:
  - Bar charts: Orders per weekday.
  - Pie chart: Size-wise distribution of items sold.
  - Line chart: Monthly sales trends.
